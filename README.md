# Codr - CLI tool to help start your coding projects

## Class XII CS Project - [Demo](https://github.com/gigabite-pro/codr)
<br>

## Problem
Beginners in software development have a lot of ideas they want to work on but don't yet have the technical know-how to set up their projects. This becomes especially tedious and difficult when they are bombarded with multiple templates and boilerplates on the internet. 
This variety of options and solutions to their problem leads to them getting confused and often quitting upon the idea. 

Additionally, even experienced developers when learning a new technology don’t have an idea how to set up the basic project folder structure. All of this creates the need for an easy-to-use and more accessible project management system.

## Solution
Codr is an CLI tool. It uses CSV files instead of a SQL database to reduce external dependencies and make the product more accessible. There is a menu that would be displayed to the user, where he can initially choose to either register or log in. Once he’s logged in, the menu would display the commands which the user can run to perform further actions.

## Objective
Our objective with Codr is to help beginners in creating and managing their projects through an easy-to-use interface. Codr will allow users to create new projects of varying technologies, view older projects, and search for projects using a specific command for each.

## Features
1. Register: to enable registration for new users<br>
2. Login: for existing users who want to login into their accounts<br>
3. Create: to create a new project of a particular technology<br>
4. View: to view past projects along with their details<br>
5. Search: to search for projects created using our tool<br>
